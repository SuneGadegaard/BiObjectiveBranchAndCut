# BiObjectiveBranchAndCut
Contains code for a bi objective branch and cut algorithm which can be used for bi objective combinatorial optimization in minimization form.

# Description
The algorithm in this repository implements a branch and cut algorithm for bi objective combinatorial optimization problems.
It is still in a developing phase, which basically means the code might look like a construction site. Later versions will contain more documentation and a cleaner code.
